# Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling

A collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts for kaggle competition Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling.

## Description

This repository contains various experiments using different machine learning models and techniques, including:
- AutoGluon
- CatBoost with Hyperopt
- XGBoost
- LightAutoML
- Dense layers
- Generalization Gamble

Each notebook explores different aspects and implementations of these models.

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
